1. Assign "Hello World" to a variable message
2. Assign a different string to a different variable
3. Assign a number to a variable
4. Use string interpolation'ish to display the number in a string

## Objectives
* Write some JavaScript
* Understand Arrays
* Understand Hashes
* Write some methods


## Deliverables
* A CodePen account and "pen" with the solutions to the below.
* A link to aforementioned "pen" (the url of the pen will be fine and preferred) submitted to Classroom.


## Details
### Normal Mode
###### Sentence to Array
1. Turn a sentence into an Array, and select the words that are six characters long. Here's your sentence:

```
var sentence = "Schlitz four dollar toast godard truffaut bespoke neutra artisan pop-up. Chia keytar single-origin coffee sustainable disrupt.";
```

###### Data Selects
1. Create an array of movies with budgets of less than 100 and another array of movies that starred Leonard DiCaprio.

```
var movies = [];
movies.push({
